## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

-   `pattern` attribute - specifies a regular expression that the `input` element's value is checked against on form submission. Extremely useful for making forms in HTML.

-   `max` and `min` attributes - specifies the maximum and minimum value of `input`. It doesn't work on `text` type input though.
-   `maxlength` attribute - specifies the maximum number of characters for ``text` type input.

### Continued development

-   practice more form validation and the how it actually works (`action`, `method`, attributes etc.)
-   force myself to think more about the code structure before writing markup
-   try to use css `grid` more often, got too comfortable with `flex`
